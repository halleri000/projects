        <p>Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450â€“420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before a variety of plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. At this time the most common shark tooth is the cladodont, a style of thin tooth with three tines like a trident, apparently to help catch fish. The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite.

        <header><h3> Random Nonsense That I know About Sharks</h3></header>
        <ol>
            <li> Their skeleton isn't made of bone </li>
            <li> They continue to grow teeth all their life </li>
            <li> =Over 375 shark species have been identified, but only about a dozen are considered particularly dangerous. Three species are responsible for most human attackS are great white, tiger, and bull sharks.</li>
            <li>While sharks kill fewer than 20 people a year, their own numbers suffer greatly at human hands. Between 20 and 100 million sharks die each year due to fishing activity,some estimate that some shark populations have plummeted 30 to 50 percent.</li>
            <li> The largest shark is the whale shark which can grow up to 60 feet</li>
